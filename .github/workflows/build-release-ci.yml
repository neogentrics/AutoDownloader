          This release contains the latest features and bug fixes.
          
          **IMPORTANT:** Please use the **Installer ZIP** for full functionality, as the EXE relies on accompanying files.
          
          **Features & Fixes:**
          - Metadata Naming Standardization (v1.7)
          - Stability and UI Fixes (v1.6.1 - v1.7.5)
          
        # Uploads BOTH the ZIP package and the standalone EXE
