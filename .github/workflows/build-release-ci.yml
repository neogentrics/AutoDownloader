        **AutoDownloader Release Notes for $tagName**

This release finalizes the v1.8 feature set and resolves a critical bug in URL parsing.

**IMPORTANT:** Please use the **Installer ZIP** for full functionality, as the EXE relies on accompanying files.

**Features (v1.8.0 - v1.8.1):**
- **Content Verification Structure:** Added structure to retrieve official TMDB episode counts.
- **Settings System:** Fully implemented Preferences UI and backend service (Ctrl+P hotkey).

**Critical Bugfix (v1.8.1):**
- **Fixed:** Resolved the bug where direct URLs incorrectly used a hardcoded search term for metadata lookup.
