# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

This project is currently in an active alpha/beta development phase. As such, security is a moving target.

Security updates will be applied to the following versions:

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| **Latest Stable Release** (e.g., `v1.8.1`) | :white_check_mark: (Critical fixes) |
| **Current Development Branch** (`master`/`main`) | :white_check_mark: (Actively developed) |
| Older Stable Releases (e.g., `v1.7.x`) | :x: (Unsupported) |
| Pre-release Alpha/Beta branches | :x: (Unstable, do not use in production) |

We always recommend you use the **latest stable release** available from the "Releases" page.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously and appreciate your help in disclosing any vulnerabilities responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please report security vulnerabilities privately.** This is the best way to protect the project and its users.

**Preferred Method:**
Please use the **"Report a vulnerability"** feature on GitHub. This will create a private Security Advisory.

1.  Go to the main "Security" tab of the repository.
2.  Click on "Report a vulnerability."
3.  Fill out the form with as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue.

### What to Expect

Since I am the primary developer, I will do my best to respond to your report promptly.
* I will acknowledge receipt of your report within **1-3 business days**.
* I will provide an update on the vulnerability's status (e.g., "Accepted," "In Progress") within **a week**.
* I will notify you when a patch is available and ready for release.
* You will be publicly credited for your discovery (if you wish) once the vulnerability is fixed and disclosed.

**Please Note:** This is a personal, open-source project. **We do not offer monetary bounties** for vulnerability reports.
